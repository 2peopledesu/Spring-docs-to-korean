This page is where I often review the books I have read and organize the concepts to help me remember the content for a long time.

I do not copy the content of the book verbatim; instead, I summarize the key points to respect copyright.

Since I read all the books in their original language, the content may differ from the translated versions.

The attached code snippets are written by me to help understand the content of the books, so they not be found in the books and could contain errors.
